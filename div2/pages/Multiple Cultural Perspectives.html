<div class='mcpessay'><h2>Multiple Cultural Perspectives Reflection</h2>
<p>In Fall of 2013, near the start of my Division II, my close friend Shelley Rosen invited me to an event at the Queer Community Alliance Center. The Trans Student Alliance was trying to get back on its feet, and there was an open community meeting to discuss ideas and possibilities. As a reluctant member of the trans community (and someone loathe to call it that, as if it were a single group of friends), I had some level of interest in helping, though I didn’t intend to contribute much.</p>

<p>I came out of that meeting on the short list of people willing to put in the work required to seriously get the TSA off the ground. I had feelings and ideas, and I felt like if I didn’t help make it happen the way I wanted it to happen, it wouldn’t.</p>

<p>We would rename it the Gender-Identity Resource Network (later, Gender Resource Network), and my ideals and intentions, in collaboration with Shelley’s, were the driving force behind how it came to exist. GRN was such an integral part of my life and the impact I had on campus that it deserves no lesser mention than the very beginning of my retrospective essay.</p>

<p>I am using my work of building and running it for two parts of my Division II: both my CEL-2 and Multicultural Perspectives. The amount of time I poured into GRN – hundreds of hours over two years – makes this appropriate. My existence as a trans student has shaped every single aspect of my life at Hampshire, and my work with GRN has given me so many opportunities to explore the ways in which those forces have worked, both on me and my trans peers. It has been arguably more valuable than any of my academics, and is the aspect of my work that I feel will have the most lasting impact on this campus - “She has created a legacy of new community standards of inclusion and accessibility which I hope will be carried on and further developed by the next generation of Hampshire students.”</p>

<p>I’ve taken that growth, building, and community work to heart, and tried to embed those values in all of my other projects</p></div>
