		<div>CEL 2:
			<p>I will be signing for GRN for my CEL 2.</p>
			<p>As a signer for this group in its formative period, and one of the people who suggested and helped design its new structure, I'm contributing a great deal to a valuable community resource, unaddressed by any other groups or organizations on campus. The goal of its structure and execution (a small, durable hub that sponsors resources and meetings) is explicitly to have it be as malleable, flexible, and resilient as possible, to best be an enduring and specific resource fit to the needs of community members. I expect this to take much, much more of my time than 40 hours over the course of the next few years.</p>

	<h2>Description of Division II Concentration</h2>
	<p>My focuses in Division II will be on computer science, primarily at this time in programming, and syntax. Potentially, I will be studying computational linguistics.</p>
	<p>I plan to spend this coming summer in Trier, attempting to bring my spoken German closer to fluency. From there, I am taking all of the core classes of a computer science degree at Amherst (skipping Intro to Comp Sci II). I plan to take more syntax courses, some computational linguistics courses, and assorted programming-oriented courses. This should give me a good base for pursuing a Div III in computer science, though I'm currently not sure where I will take my Div III</p>
	<hr>

	<h2>Multiple Cultural Perspectives</h2>
	<p>I believe that learning German has and will continue to prove vital to examining the way in which I think - languages are wonderful opportunities to look at other cultures from a very foundational level.</p>
	<p>I will also continue to look out for classes that will help me continue to explore multi-cultural issues that I studied as part of Division I.</p>
	<p>Further, I am a signer and part of the re-founding effort for an ambitious identity-based student group on campus, GRN (gender-identity resource network), formerly TSA (trans student alliance). We aim to be a framework and resource hub which can provide services of all sorts to trans students on campus, ranging from event and meeting organization help, to networking, to a hampedia page with useful links, to a combination-locked box with clothes for trans students.</p>
	<p>This will be an incredible resource for trans students on campus, and I intend to write about it in my retrospective essay.</p>
