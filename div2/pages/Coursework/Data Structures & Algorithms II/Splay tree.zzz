Implementation of a splay tree in Python. Splay trees are a particular variety of binary search trees (where each node has two children, and its left child is smaller while its right child is greater - equal elements are either left or right, depending on the specific implementation). Splay trees differ in that, whenever any node is accessed, it is "splayed" - brought up to the root of the tree. For many uses, recently accessed nodes are likely to be accessed again soon, and so a splay tree can significantly reduce access time.
