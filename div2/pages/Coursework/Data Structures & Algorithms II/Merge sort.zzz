This is an implementation of merge sort in Python. Essentially, if you have an unsorted list, you can cut it in half and sort each half, and then merge upwards - for example, if your two lists are 1,3 and 2,4, you compare 1 and 2, put 1 at the start of your list, compare 2 and 3, etc, until you have 1,2,3,4.
However, there's no reason to not keep splitting the lists. Merge sort does exactly that, splitting the list in half until each one is only a single element (at which point it is sorted by definition), and then merging up until the whole list is sorted.
