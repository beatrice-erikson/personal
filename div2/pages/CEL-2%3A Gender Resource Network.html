					<p>Since January 2014, Bea has been leading and organizing the Gender Resource Network. She was a founding signer and member, who proposed a lot of the defining ideas, vision, and structure for the group. She has helped create the Gender Affirming Regalia Box, a program to get clothing to young transgender and gender non-conforming people who need help transitioning their wardrobe. She also spearheaded a process of meeting with nearly ever office on campus and mapping out the college's database systems so that she could better find solutions for the various occasions where the legal names of students on file are leaked or used in innappropriate places, thus outing many transgender students. I believe she now is one of the most knowlegable people on campus about Hampshire's student information infrastructure.</p>
					<p>In addition to these major projects, Bea has organized many bi-weekly workshops and programs for transgender students to meet, learn, and grow. Among these have been screenings of media depicting transgender people in an accuate and positive manner, sub-free alternative events on nights with heavy substance-use around campus, and various workshops centered around creating art to process and express the trans experience.  She has created a legacy of new community standards of inclusion and accessibility which I hope will be carried on and futher developed by the next generation of Hampshire students.</p>
