<h2>Retrospective Essay</h2>
<p>My Division II has been a long process, trying to actively study and pursue reasonable academics while simultaneously figuring out which pieces were ultimately important to me. My interests are exceptionally broad but consist of oddly specific knowledge, and the number of times I wished I had changed my course of study again is hard to count.</p>
<p>My academics themselves look fairly standard. I took all of the core classes for a computer science major at Amherst College; I continued my study of German up to nearly the highest levels of courses offered; I took a few more courses to deepen my practical knowledge of programming and software engineering.</p>
<p>But that isn’t an accurate account of my time, life, or work.</p>
<br />
<p>In Fall of 2013, near the start of my Division II, my close friend Shelley Rosen invited me to an event at the Queer Community Alliance Center. The Trans Student Alliance was trying to get back on its feet, and there was an open community meeting to discuss ideas and possibilities. As a reluctant member of the trans community (and someone loathe to call it that, as if it were a single group of friends), I had some level of interest in helping, though I didn’t intend to contribute much.</p>
<p>I came out of that meeting on the short list of people willing to put in the work required to seriously get the TSA off the ground. I had feelings and ideas, and I felt like if I didn’t help make it happen the way I wanted it to happen, it wouldn’t.</p>
<p>We would rename it the Gender-Identity Resource Network (later, Gender Resource Network), and my ideals and intentions, in collaboration with Shelley’s, were the driving force behind how it came to exist. GRN was such an integral part of my life and the impact I had on campus that it deserves no lesser mention than the very beginning of my retrospective essay.</p>
<p>I am using my work of building and running it for two parts of my Division II: both my CEL-2 and Multicultural Perspectives. The amount of time I poured into GRN – hundreds of hours over two years – makes this appropriate. My existence as a trans student has shaped every single aspect of my life at Hampshire, and my work with GRN has given me so many opportunities to explore the ways in which those forces have worked, both on me and my trans peers. It has been arguably more valuable than any of my academics, and is the aspect of my work that I feel will have the most lasting impact on this campus - “She has created a legacy of new community standards of inclusion and accessibility which I hope will be carried on and further developed by the next generation of Hampshire students.”</p>
<br />
<p>I’ve taken that growth, building, and community work to heart, and tried to embed those values in all of my other projects. My academic interests have resultantly shifted from more abstract computer science and linguistic work, to hands-on problem solving in technology. Coming in to the end of my Division II, and looking towards what I wanted to be doing for my Division III project, I created my independent study (Functional Programming: Haskell and Clojure), and took Database-Driven Websites.</p>
<p>Both of those classes were intended to give me more practical experience, something I’ve come to value greatly. For my Division III project, I want to build something – large, missing, and valuable. I’ve considered writing a gem in ruby, for example, that would enable rails html generation to automate and access ARIA tags. Rails is used to make actual database-driven websites by professional programmers and actual companies; my friends who do so for a living were ecstatic at the idea. With the way rails is structured, it’s impossible to get at a large portion of ARIA tags without severely hindering the ways in which your website can work – but ARIA tags are an important part of web accessibility, and consistently having them enables easier use of devices such as screen readers.</p>
<p>As it turns out, this already exists (the gem WAIAble). But the essence of the idea is the best way I can explain how my focus has shifted. Community building, inclusivity, and practical impactful design have become core values. They’ve shaped my Division II and will form the basis for my work in Division III, whatever that ends up being specifically. I’ve narrowed down on to specifically computer science and engineering, because that is the location along which I have the most relevant skills and the clearest path for creating and accomplishing my goals.</p>
<br />
<p>My initial focus, in my study of computer science, was fairly theoretical. I started out slowly, as I was still trying to figure out what I was studying coming in to my Division II. Fall 2013, the only computer science course I took was Intro to Computer Science I. I was already familiar with all of the concepts in the class, and the professor recommended I skip Intro to Computer Science II. I decided, after comparing my work in computer science and my Division I work in anthropology and sociology, that computer science was both what I wanted to be doing and what I was better at. The fastest and most structured way to do that seemed to be taking all the core classes at Amherst College – since Data Structures and Algorithms I was the only relevant class I had the prerequisites for, I signed up for it for Spring semester.</p>
<p>I realized that the part of computer science classes I enjoyed the most was actual implementation. Data Structures & Algorithms I was easy. The implementation was challenging but fun, and the conceptual areas were easy for me to grasp. Data Structures & Algorithms II, which I took the following fall, was much harder. The theoretical math involved was a struggle. I had already realized I wanted more practical experience – I spent the summer of 2014 designing an independent study. I believe the opening line of my syllabus is an accurate description of my goals: “This intensive course is designed to explore two functional languages, to promote flexibility in thinking and expanded programmatical reasoning.”</p>
<br />
<p>I believe my work in that class accomplished that goal, but more importantly, it provided a stark contrast: my classes that semester were Computer Systems I (a hands-on course about the inner workings of computers and chip logic), my independent study (a hands-on programming course), and Data Structures & Algorithms II (a theoretical course with programming assignments). It became more and more obvious that I just wasn’t interested in the theoretical underpinnings of computer science if I couldn’t do something immediately constructive with that knowledge.</p>
<p>Spring semester 2015 cemented that further, and I realized the parallels between my interests in computer science and my active participation in community building on campus. I took Database-Driven Websites and was introduced to Ruby on Rails, and given the opportunity to develop a large web project. The result of that work was Faceplant, an ambitious social website with many features for keeping track of and sharing information about houseplants that users own. I intend to develop it further, and am setting up my own server in the student server room so I can deploy it properly.</p>
<p>I also took Computer Systems II – a course dedicated to exploring how the most basic programming of computers works. For our final project in that class, we were supposed to implement a kernel as a large group project, with between 3-6 group members. I had had various health issues throughout the semester, though, and had missed a number of classes. My stubbornness took over, and I unilaterally decided I needed to prove I had absorbed the material despite my absences: I needed to do the final project by myself, and not rely on classmates to fill in any gaps.</p>
<p>It was incredibly challenging, and there were a number of times in the middle of finals that I regretted that decision. But ultimately, I stuck with it, and I completed nearly every aspect of the kernel the professor had asked for – a project which he had said no group had ever completely implemented. I didn’t completely implement it either, but I came very close. And I did it entirely by myself.</p>
<br />
<p>From that semester, I learned how fulfilling practical development work is for me. I’m taking Software Engineering as one of my Advanced Learning Activities for my Division III – as much as I enjoy solo development work and massive projects, it seems important to be able to effectively develop on a team. I want to take that energy and drive, and funnel it into something big and important – something that accomplishes real change, like I affected in my work in GRN. I didn’t acquire all the skills I need for that kind of Division III project during my Division II, because of how much time and energy it took me to actually find where I was going. But I believe I’ve put myself in a position where I can still acquire those skills as I need them, and I’m confident that I’ve learned how to reactively acquire skills - a meta-skill essential for practical problem-solving.</p>
<p>My Division II doesn’t stand on its own – it doesn’t have a clear, clean ending. It doesn’t have a final product, or a collection of essays. It doesn’t even have a particularly coherent, explainable list of gained skills. But it has put me exactly where I need to be to accomplish what I want from my education – and that seems more important and powerful to me, personally, than anything that I could readily explain in less words.</p>
