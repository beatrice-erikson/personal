<td><h4>Narrative Description of Student Performance</h4>
<div><p>Beatrice Corfman has demonstrated an excellent grasp of the material covered in the Beginning Yiddish class. She missed a number of classes in the earlier part of the semester and several conversation sections at the end of the semester, but she generally did well on homework assignments and caught up on all material by the end of the semester. Beatrice always asked very thoughtful questions in class that demonstrated a close engagement with the material and appeared enthusiastic about learning Yiddish. She did very well on assessments but struggled occasionally with spelling and pronunciation due to a previous knowledge of German, which is very similar to Yiddish. Beatrice initially was not very engaged during group and partner activities but as the class progressed participated more in those modules. I hope Beatrice will continue with her Yiddish studies.</p></div></td>

<td><h4>Self Evaluation</h4>

<div><p>I enjoyed learning Yiddish greatly, though I feel as if I could have done much better and spent more time working on the class.</p>

<p>Generally, I was frustrated with the pace of the class, and feel as though a large number of the other students did not take the class seriously or understand the amount of effort required to learn another language. I feel as if this observation is backed up by the amount of material we made it through (just to the beginning of chapter four), compared to what was supposed to have been on the final (through chapter five).</p>

<p>As a result of this, I was discouraged. Still, it was my responsibility to put a certain amount of effort into this class, and I definitely should have practiced more and could have done better on what we did study, even if I was doing better than a lot of the rest of the class (It is also important to note here, I feel, that I have taken quite a few college-level German courses, and Yiddish and German are similar languages).</p></div>
