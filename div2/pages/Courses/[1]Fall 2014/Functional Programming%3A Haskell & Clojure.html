<td><h4>Narrative Description of Student Performance</h4>
<div><p>In this independent study activity Beatrice Corfman learned two "functional" programming languages, Haskell and Clojure, and engaged in independent computer programming project work. Beatrice used the book Learn You a Haskell for Great Good! A Beginner's Guide, by Miran Lipovaca, and a series of online Clojure tutorials called "Clojure from the Ground Up," by Kyle Kingsbury. Beatrice submitted a description of the material that was covered, a self evaluation, portfolios of code in each language, and instructions for running the code. Beatrice was self-directed and independent in the completion of the work for this activity, and seems to have developed significant practical skill with each language while also coming to better appreciate the principles of functional programming languages. Overall, Beatrice’s performance was excellent. I think that Beatrice learned a great deal from participation in this activity.</p></div></td>
<td><h4>Self Evaluation</h4>
<div>
<p>This independent study was very ambitious – I realized shortly into the semester that even after trimming it down to its current state, it was still a lot of reading and a lot of new concepts to learn.</p>
<p>I made it through nine chapters (about 200 pages) of “Learn You a Haskell for Great Good,” and experimented and practiced whenever I had the chance – Haskell was an incredibly fun language for me. I also solved some Project Euler problems using Haskell, and a number of problems from “99 Haskell Problems”</p>
<p>For Clojure, I read the entirety of “Clojure from the Ground Up,” doing the practice problems and problems on 4clojure as I went along. I had a very short timeframe to do so, but I feel confident in saying that I accomplished a respectable amount of work, and learned a good deal about Clojure.</p>
<p>Finally, I put together a single final project, in Clojure – using Nightmod, a REPL designed for game making, I implemented the game Flood It. I didn’t manage to finish it, but ran into, overcame, and learned from a large number of difficulties in implementation. The game is actually fairly close to complete, and I intend to finish it at some point soon as a continued exercise.</p>
<p>I didn’t accomplish everything I wanted to, but I have definitely become a more flexible programmer, and gotten a good feel for functional programming languages. For other classes this semester, I’ve had to write code using Python, and I saw a qualitative difference in how my code was structured and organized. Despite quite a lot of stuttering, pauses, and setbacks, I’m fairly happy with what I learned in the context of this independent study.</p></div></td>
