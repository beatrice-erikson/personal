<td><h4>Narrative Description of Student Performance</h4>
<div><p>Beatrice did very good work this semester. Her homeworks were always on time, and she always responded well to the feedback she was receiving on those homeworks, which were mostly clarifying questions I had. Her code was always well thought out and correct. Her homework on table normalizing was well executed, specially given the high number of tables and attributes involved.</p>

<p>For her final project Beatrice developed a system to store and display information about plants and the care and maintenance she had received. So, for example, Beatrice developed tables to store information such as where each plant was being stored, when the plants had been watered or transplanted last, what pot they were in, and so forth. Beatrice made use of the bcrypt Ruby Gem to keep track of user accounts and user sessions. Beatrice also validated important fields such as passwords and the uniqueness of certain fields. Finally, Beatrice developed a visually pleasant web site through which to interact with the database tables, and made use of the Amistad Gem in order to integrate friendship relationships between users. In these two items Beatrice went above and beyond what was required of her in the course.</p>

<p>In closing, Beatrice did very good work this semester. Through the course she has demonstrated very good engagement with both the theory and practice of database systems. She is certainly prepared to do more advanced work in the topic, if she so chooses to. It was great to have her in the course this semester.</p></div></td>
<td><h4>Self Evaluation</h4>
<div><p>I greatly enjoyed Database-Driven Websites, both producing good work and gaining a number of practical skills that should come in useful for my Div III work.</p>
<p>My main work in this class was a single large project, a database-driven website implemented in Ruby on Rails. I worked on it continuously throughout the semester.</p>
<p>I actually implemented it a few times: as I developed the site, figured out what I wanted it to do, and learned more about Rails, it occasionally made more sense to implement the entire site mostly from scratch. I'm hoping to learn better how to set comprehensive specifications, but as a learning project this was a useful approach, and I gained a lot of knowledge about how to work with Rails specifically, and databases in general.</p>
<p>I'm also very proud of the final website, and have plans to continue work on it once I set up a personal Rails server (though I'll probably re-brand it).</p></div></td>
