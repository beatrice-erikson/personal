<td><h4>Narrative Description of Student Performance</h4>
<div><p>Beatrice did a very fine job in the Chorus for the first time this semester.  She has very strong natural abilities in both pitch and rhythm.  She had no previous experience in music at all, and it was marvelous to see how she could learn music easily and function successfully in the ensemble.  Beatrice wrote a lengthy and thoughtful self-evaluation at the end of the semester.  Beatrice also had an exemplary attendance record and was quite devoted to the group.  A fine student!</p></div></td>

		<p>Yes</p></li>
	<li><p>Comment on ALL the pieces performed the semester (what you liked/found challenging/ found interesting, etc.)</p>
		<p>'m Gonna Sing:</p>
		<p>I liked this piece. It was fairly easy, upbeat, and fun.</p>
 
		<p>Elohai n'tzor l'shoni merah:</p>
		<p>This was great, and I wish I had a decent recording, as it's hard to find anyone singing this. I thought it was a very beautiful but difficult piece, and as a chorus we did an okay job of it by the time the concert came around.</p>
 
		<p>Over the Rainbow:</p>
		<p>Lots of fun! We did great with this.</p>
 
		<p>Dilmano Dilbero:</p>
		<p>I am particularly pleased with how well my section did with this. I think the bass section blended incredibly well.</p>
 
		<p>Die Nachtigall:</p>
		<p>This is a nice piece and I'm fond of German. I think we could have done a better job with hitting the notes accurately.</p>
 
		<p>April is in my Mistress' Face:</p>
		<p>This was a little challenging, but we managed to pull it together well by the end of the semester.</p>
 
		<p>Gloria:</p>
		<p>I'm a little disappointed in how this went during the concert. I'm unsure of what exactly, but the sections didn't mesh nearly as well as they could have.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>What did you learn this semester about choral singing?</p>
		<p>I learned music-reading basics, better control of my range, more confident singing, and how to sing with a group (staggered breathing, etc)</p></li>
	<li><p>Elaborate on your performance experiences this semester (concerts).</p>
		<p>I'm very pleased with how the concerts went. I think I learned the songs fairly well. I do need to work on vocal confidence and my range, but these are things that didn't stick out during the concert.</p></li>
	<li><p>Choral plans for the future?</p>
		<p>I'd like to audit this course in the fall if I have time, and plan to pursue voice lessons</p></li>
	<li><p>Please explain any absences</p>
		<p>I'm not sure I had any. I may have missed one class due to illness, and I stepped out early once or twice because I didn't feel well.</p></li>
